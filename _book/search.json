So the following function works regardless of the input we give it (well, not completely regardless)\n\nmy_solve(a, b, c) = (c - b) / a\n\nmy_solve (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\nmy_solve(10, 5, 30)\n\n2.5\n\n\n\nmy_solve(10 + 5im, 5, 30)\n\n2.0 - 1.0im\n\n\nThis is important bc it means much of linear algebra will work for real numbers as well as complex numbers.\n\n\n1.1.2 Playing with Complex Numbers\nTypically, complex numbers are plotted on the complex plane. Plots will separate out the real and complex numbers for us:\n\nS = [2 + 2im, 3 + 2im, 1.75 + 1im, 2 + 1im, 2.25 + 1im, 2.5 + 1im, 3 + 1im]\n\nscatter(S)\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe absolute value of a complex number is the distance to the point on the complex plane (think Pythagorean theorem)\n\nabs(S[1])\n\n2.8284271247461903\n\n\nThe conjugate of a complex number, z, written \\(\\bar{z}\\), is z.real - z.imaginary"
